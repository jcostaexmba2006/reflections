When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
in order to back up or share mi code with other people


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

becouse maybe i haver some changes that doesn´t work very well

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is the github to github, clone is from github to local and branch is just only in local or in github
