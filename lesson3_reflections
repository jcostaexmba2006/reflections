When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
in order to back up or share mi code with other people


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

becouse maybe i haver some changes that doesnÂ´t work very well
