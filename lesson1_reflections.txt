How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it is very interesting and save time

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Becouse you are all the time introducing changes and in this way you can see the previous one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    the main difference to me is the logical concept, you loose the logical concept with having versions automatically saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    thanks of the concept of the repository, it groups some files in one bag

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    first of all y use git log to identifi the git ID, secondly i can use git diff to see the differences between the commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    or course, always you can reverse the changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
